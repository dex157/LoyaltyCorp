# Frontend

The goal is to create a single page app using Vue with a sticky header and
carousel in it. Feel free to use the Vue CLI to get the task up and going (or if
you have your own boilerplate / webpack / approach you are welcome to use that).

The page will have the following

## The header

Should have 3 navigation items (they can link to #) named home, about us and
contact us.

Font size / font / colors I will leave to you

It needs to be responsive

You can add blank space at the end of the document so that I can test the
stickyness on mobile and desktop devices

## The carousel

Will just hold images, no text or links needed, you can decide the images to use

The carousel should be responsive and be able to adjust how many items can be
displayed at different breakpoints.

I would like to see 3 carousel items on desktop and only one on mobile.

The carousel should also work on mobile

Design choices in regards to colors / chevrons etc I will leave to you.

CSS/JS libraries, images, structure of assets I will leave to you and use
whatever mixins / sass / less you are comfortable with.

## Once complete can you please

Put your code into a public repo that I can access

If necessary include instructions (such as npm run build)

How much time it took to finish and send an email back to me with the link.
